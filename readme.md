# Text Diff Utilities

<p>
  <strong>text_diff_color_utilities.py:</strong> diff the strings and highlight in different colors, 
  e.g. <span style="color: red;">removed</span> in red, 
  <span style="color: green;">add</span> in green (amend), 
  and <span style="color: blue;">change without lengthening</span> in blue (emend).
